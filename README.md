# Responsive Portfolio

Second version of my Responsive Portfolio

This page uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:
* 97.8% HTML
* 2.2% CSS
* Some Bootstrap Magic (immesurable!)
* Some Javascript to run the navbar collapsable feature properly

My goal was to create a mobile-friendly and responsive website that would be rendered properly on a variety of different screens, regardless of their sizes.

Navigation bar is collapsable on smaller screens.
Headers on each page are left-aligned on larger screens. On smaller screens they are centered.

Main page and each sub-page utilize Bootstrap's features.
Portfolio page uses Bootstrap grid (columns and rows) to visualize my ficticious projects.

Pages do not have any margins on extra small screens - they fill the entire width of the page to better use limited screen size. However, pages have some margins on small & larger screens. However, 

Contact form was added as directed.

My profile picture on index.html is "3-columns" wide, but on smaller screens it fills the whole width.

I used semantic HTML tags(keeping in mind SEO and accessibility), such as: nav, section, header, footer, figure, and figcaption.

I found a way to create Sticky Footers although I didn't use Bootstrap tools to do so.

As you can see, I played a little with Bootstrap navigation bar colors and added some background color.

There are two links to my social media accounts: LinkedIn and Github.

Containers have borders and rounded edges (thanks to Bootstrap's class properties).

I validated HTML using the W3C Markup Validation Service: https://validator.w3.org/ and it seemed alright.

There are fewer commits than I made in reality as I started this portfolio again from scratch after I had realized that my css & image links as well as "assets" folder were a bit messy.
